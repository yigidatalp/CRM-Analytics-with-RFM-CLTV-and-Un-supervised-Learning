# CRM-Analytics-with-RFM-CLTV-and-Un-supervised-Learning
I performed CRM Analytics with RFM segmentation and CTLV calculation. 
Based on these, I applied a Clustering algorithm to segment customers as an unsupervised learning.
Based on RFM, CLTV and Clustering labels, I calculated the final score as a target. And, then I applied a Classification algorithm as a supervised learning to predict customer segmentation.
